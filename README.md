I'm Arianna, a FrontEnd developer from Argentina with knowledge in JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS and control applications such as Git and GitHub,
as well with a good level of English and currently learning database with SQL. I'm passionate about the world of tech, solving problems, and constantly improving myself. I like to keep in touch with new tools and diverse technology to continue growing in the area.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects.
- Outside tech, ðŸ“– I love listen to music ðŸŽµ, explore nature outdoors ðŸŒ´ and spend time with my family.
